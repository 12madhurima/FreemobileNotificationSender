{"name":"Freemobile notification sender","tagline":"Add SMS notifications using Free Mobile to your PHP projects","body":"FreemobileNotificationSender (FNS)\r\n==================================\r\n\r\nFreemobileNotificationSender (FNS, for short) is a simple PHP class to allow people to send SMS notifications using Free's APIs.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nFirstly, you will need to setup your Free Mobile account to enable the SMS API. You will also find on Free Mobile's website the credentials you need to use the API.\r\n\r\n## Test the API\r\n\r\nCopy the `config.example.php` file in order to edit it :\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ncp config.example.php config.php\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen edit config.php to match your API's credentials. Once everything is set, run `testapi.php`. You should receive a 160-characters SMS.\r\n\r\n## Integrating FNS in your own applications\r\n\r\nIf you are using Packagist to maintain your project's dependencies, you can use it to embed an updated version of FNS. Simply add this in your _composer.json_ file :\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"require\":{\r\n    \"tibounise/freemobilenotificationsender\":\"1.*\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Laravel, you may consider using [aeyoll's](https://github.com/aeyoll) FNS wrapper, available [here](https://github.com/aeyoll/laravel-free-mobile-notification-sender).\r\n\r\n## Support me !\r\n\r\nIf this project helped you a lot, please consider donating : [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=K65LZXQXASC8E) or [Bitcoin](https://blockchain.info/address/13XFkvDBm8iqbwVC1egYZ8sCSu72eebJ7N).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
